# Deep-Learning-Data-Augmentation-Using-Beans-Dataset
Demo of data augmentation: a technique to increase the diversity of your training set by applying random (but realistic) transformations, such as image rotation

**Learnings:**
* Used Keras preprocessing layers for data augmentation - Got 68% accuracy
* Used Custom data augmentation - Got 70% accuracy
